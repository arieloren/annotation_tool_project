For launching the program, please insert the input images directory path (the directory which contains the images files) and the target directory path 
(where saving the images head's features).

For example:

python annotation_tool.py --imageDir dataset --saveDir test

Where: 
--imageDir: is the input images directory path
--saveDir: is the target directory path
 
For annotating the image:

1. When 'q' key is pressed, the program saves all the data and exits.

2. When 's' key is pressed - save current data.

3. When left arrow key is pressed, go to the previous image (It's possible also to press the key 'l' 
if there is technical issue with the arrow key value, although it's working on my computer).

4. When right arrow key is pressed, go to the next image  (It's possible also to press the key 'r' 
if there is technical issue with the arrow key value, although it's working on my computer).

5. When 'd' is pressed, delete last specified rectangles in the current image.


For any further question, please feel free to contact me,

Thanks!
